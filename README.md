### üõ† Skills

*   Writing code that works (sometimes)
    
*   Spending hours fixing a bug, turns out it was a semicolon
    
*   Naming convention - \`final.js\` | \`thisisfinal.js\` |\`extremefinal.js\`
    
*   \`parent.killChild(this);\` // RIP bad ideas
    
*   \`document.body.removeChild(document.body.firstChild);\` // You saw nothing
    
*   CSS: \`div:nth-child(666) { display: none; }\` /\* Vanished into the abyss \*/
    
*   \`let orphan = document.querySelector(".child"); orphan.remove();\` // No one will notice
    
*   \`git commit -m "Fixed a bug" && git push && immediately\_regret()\`
    
*   Breaking things to fix them
    

### ‚ö° Current Status

*   Trying to make sense of my own code from last week.
    
*   Debugging the debugger that debugs my code.
    
*   Trying to push a project, but Git says "Merge conflict".
    
*   Wondering why my function doesn‚Äôt return anything (oh, forgot the return statement).
    
*   Spending 3 hours fixing a bug, only to realize it's a semicolon.
    
*   Thinking "This will only take 5 minutes" and then it's 3 AM.
    
*   I removed a child element, and now I hear whispers in my console.
    

### üèÜ Achievement Unlocked

*   Wrote code that worked on the first try (and panicked).
    
*   Closed VS Code thinking it would fix my issue.
    
*   Thought about using AI to write my code, but AI responded with Inappropriate content.
    
*   \`npm install\` ‚Äî Summoned the package demons
    
*   rm -rf /hope ‚Äî Operation successful
    
*   Thinking "This will only take 5 minutes" and then it's 3 AM.
    
*   I removed a child element, and now I hear whispers in my console.
    

üï≥Ô∏è Where You‚Äôll Find Me
------------------------

*   **In your dev console**: \`console.log("I'm still here...")\`
    
*   **In your CSS file**: \`:nth-child(999) { visibility: hidden; }\`
    
*   **In your GitHub commits**: --force push and pray
    
*   **Inside a function that never returns**
    
*   \`exit(0);\` // Just kidding, I'll be back.
